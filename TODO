TODO::
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Re-organize everything.. keep functions in library and improve filtering data.

BUGS:

  CONTRACTS:
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - IMPLEMENT CLONE PROXY! (https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#TransparentUpgradeableProxy)
  - User can unlock and keep voting, but result is taken from total locked attribute

  UI
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Before the buyer claims, its not possible to claim the revenues, pospone and check it has been created
  - My NFTs reads and handle arbitrarely some NFTs (ERC1155 subId 1 are considered fraktions by 'default')
  - Opensea API is veery slow to detect transfers
  - Read account shares (minus total released) in revenues contracts.. display if only.
  - There is no tx handler (besides metamask)
  - Complete redirectings in the dapp.
  - Incorrect networks does not work very well, does not detect network change (add listener)
  - Does detect account change.. but is buggy..
  - Claims are radio group. What is the best way? (list?)

  SUBGRAPH
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Does not detect ERC1155 transfers so ownership is not followed.
  - When importing NFTs, subgraph duplicates the fraktions. Minted event its called from the market.
  - claim fraktal does not change ownership
  - in revenues, add a timedate for reference
