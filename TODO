BUGS:
  CONTRACTS:
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - IMPLEMENT CLONE PROXY!

  - Once an item is sold ANYONE can claim it
    -send it in the sellItem process to the buyer (functions is already hiper heavy)
    -or assign the buyer with the right (modify contracts)
  - Multiple votes from the same user are allowed (and summed!)
  - Revenue for fraktions in market property at sold time will be locked (belong to the market and do not have a call to retrieve it)

  UI
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Handle imported NFT's multiple hashes (ipfs or whatever).. currently failing items are not displayed!!
  - There is no tx handler (besides metamask) nor redirecting in the dapp.
  - Claims are a list, we are only handling 1 in the UI (first one with value, which makes it "recursive")
  - Items should be listed to have the UI that allows making offers (if no listed fraktions, page fails)
  - Incorrect networks does not work very well, does not detect network change (add listener)

  SUBGRAPH
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Does not detect releases from payment channels (doesnt detect fraktions burned on sell)
  - Does not detect ERC1155 transfers so ownership is not followed.
