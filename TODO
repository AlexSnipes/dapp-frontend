TODO::
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everything on the nft will be in a /details page
- Make components for the data displayers and functions
  - Fraktions listed (and buy options)
  - Offers (makeOffer & offers history & voting)
  - Revenues (addRevenue & list of Revenues & claim)

- Add a Defraktionalize function in the market to handle the escrow of the fraktal (otherwise is free to claim)

BUGS:
  - ItemListed event had a uint256 for numberOfShares. was changed to a uint16 but the event called the older type
   -also in handlebought

  CONTRACTS:
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - User can unlock and keep voting, but result is taken from total locked attribute
  - Opensea assets in rinkeby have id > uint256 !! they fail on import (overflow)

  UI
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - NFT item component hover (and amount/price location)
  - Opensea API is veery slow to detect transfers
  - Read account shares (minus total released) in revenues contracts.. display if only.
  - There is no tx handler (besides metamask)
  - Complete redirectings in the dapp.
  - Incorrect networks does not work very well, does not detect network change (add listener)
  - Does detect account change.. but is buggy..
  - Claims are radio group. What is the best way? (list?)

  SUBGRAPH
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Does not detect ERC1155 transfers so ownership is not followed.
  - in revenues, add a timedate for reference
