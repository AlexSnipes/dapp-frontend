BUGS:
  CONTRACTS:
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - IMPLEMENT CLONE PROXY!
  - User can unlock and keep voting, but result is taken from total locked attribute

  UI
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - My NFTs reads and handle arbitrarely some NFTs (ERC1155 subId 1 are considered fraktions by 'default')
  - Some opensea assets has overflow problems on importing.. handle it (?)
  - Handle imported NFT's multiple hashes (ipfs or whatever).. currently failing items are not displayed!!
  - Read account shares (minus total released) in revenues contracts.. display if only.
  
  - There is no tx handler (besides metamask)
  - Complete redirectings in the dapp.
  - Items should be listed to have the UI that allows making offers (if no listed fraktions, page fails)
  - Incorrect networks does not work very well, does not detect network change (add listener)
  - Does detect account change.. but is buggy..
  - Claims are a list, we are only handling 1 in the UI (first one with value, which makes it "recursive")

  SUBGRAPH
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Handle fraktions burn (or payment releases)
  - Handle users list and shares of each
  - Does not detect ERC1155 transfers so ownership is not followed.
