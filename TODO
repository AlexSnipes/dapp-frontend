BUGS:

  CONTRACTS:
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - IMPLEMENT CLONE PROXY! (https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#TransparentUpgradeableProxy)
  - User can unlock and keep voting, but result is taken from total locked attribute
  - Opensea assets in rinkeby have id > uint256 !! they fail on import (overflow)

  UI
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - CONNECT THE CLAIM COLLATERAL FUNCTION!
  - Opensea API is veery slow to detect transfers
  - Read account shares (minus total released) in revenues contracts.. display if only.
  - There is no tx handler (besides metamask)
  - Complete redirectings in the dapp.
  - Incorrect networks does not work very well, does not detect network change (add listener)
  - Does detect account change.. but is buggy..
  - Claims are radio group. What is the best way? (list?)

  SUBGRAPH
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - IS NOT GETTING MARKET EVENTS! (check out how to have 2 contracts to follow (factory & market))
  - Does not detect ERC1155 transfers so ownership is not followed.
  - in revenues, add a timedate for reference
